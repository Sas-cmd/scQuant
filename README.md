Quantifying and comparing heterogeneity within and between scRNA-seq datasets remains a challenge. Here, we introduce scQuant, a novel bioinformatics tool and R package  designed to address this challenge. scQuant get its name from its method of leveraging quantiles to generate statistics across these quantiles, providing a more comprehensive representation of cellular heterogeneity. 
 

## Installation
Please install the development version of scQuant from github using the `remotes` package: 

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Sas-cmd/scQuant")
```
